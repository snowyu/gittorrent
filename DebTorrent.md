The project has as a goal "to expand on the BitTorrent protocol and application to work effectively with large, constantly updating collections of files, and therefore enable the efficient peer-to-peer downloading of Debian packages from an APT repository." [(Alioth project page)](http://debtorrent.alioth.debian.org/)

The main motivation is that "upon completion and widescale deployment of the service, the bandwidth and hardware costs of providing a very large Debian archive to hundreds of thousands of users will be dramatically reduced." [(wiki page)](http://wiki.debian.org/DebTorrent).
